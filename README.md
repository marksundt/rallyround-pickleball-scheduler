RallyRound is a single-page web application designed to effortlessly generate round-robin schedules for doubles pickleball. Users can input a list of player names and specify the number of available courts. The application's core logic then calculates and displays a balanced schedule, ensuring players are rotated to play with and against different opponents across multiple rounds. For scenarios with more players than court capacity, the scheduler intelligently assigns 'byes' (sit-out rounds) to players, ensuring everyone gets fair playing time. The interface is designed to be intuitive, clean, and highly interactive, providing a seamless experience from player entry to viewing the final, beautifully rendered schedule.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy of the project up and running for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18 or later)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
- [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd rallyround_scheduler
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    This project uses Bun for package management.
    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

### Running the Development Server

To start the local development server, run the following command:

```bash
bun run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

- `src/`: Contains all the frontend React application code.
  - `pages/HomePage.tsx`: The main and only page for the application.
  - `components/`: Reusable React components.
  - `store/`: Zustand store for global state management.
  - `lib/`: Utility functions, including the core scheduling logic.
- `worker/`: Contains the Cloudflare Worker backend code provided by the template. Note: This application is fully client-side, so the worker primarily serves the built assets.
- `shared/`: TypeScript types shared between the frontend and worker.
- `wrangler.jsonc`: Configuration file for the Cloudflare Worker.

## üöÄ Deployment

This application is designed to be deployed seamlessly to the Cloudflare network.

1.  **Login to Wrangler:**
    Ensure you are logged into your Cloudflare account via the Wrangler CLI.
    ```bash
    wrangler login
    ```

2.  **Build and Deploy:**
    The `deploy` script in `package.json` handles building the application and deploying it using Wrangler.
    ```bash
    bun run deploy
    ```

This command will build the Vite frontend, then deploy the application and the associated worker to your Cloudflare account.

Alternatively, you can deploy your own version of this project with a single click.
